 			<p> The 3 pictures represent the 3 best teams I have seen play in their 3 different era's. They all have overcome every single problem they went thrpugh. All of them had mutiple championships together. The chicago bulls has 6 championship that are two 3-peats. While for the Los Angeles Lakers they have one 3-peat which is from 2000-2002. The warriors only have one back-to-back championships. Most of the roaster of each team changed but the chicago bulls were the one's who standed out the best all of their core players mostly won championships through out those 6 championships. All of these players have a core factor in this current era that nba is having rn. Thanks to these players and teams they made basketball better. Basketball will get better from time to time due to the influence that the players give .</p>
